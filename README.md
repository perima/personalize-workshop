# 1. Setup S3
------

## 1.1 Create bucket S3 
Please note we are using us-west-2 region (Oregon) for this workshop.

For this workshop we will need to setup a bucket we will use for
personalize. Go to S3 console
<https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2>, and create
a new bucket to be used for this workshop.

Keep the bucket name handy as we will need it in a few places.

## 1.2 Setup bucket policy
Go to S3 console, select the bucket you created earlier for this
workshop and select properties-\>permissions. Then select the bucket
policy button and copy the policy below and click **save**.

Don't forget to change the resource details to the bucket you created
for this workshop.

```

		]
	}]
}

```

# 2. Setup your development environment
We will be using Cloud9 for this workshop. Go to the Cloud9 console and
create a new environment:

<https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-west-2>.

Name the environment **personalize-workshop**

# 6. Tracker solution
Whilst we wait for our imports to complete, we will setup our solution to ingest events from our single page application. 

For this you need to select the SDK installation from the dashboard.

![alt text](workshop-images/6.png)

Please note this step will take a few minutes to complete (\~15
minutes). Wait for **both** **imports** to show as active
**before** proceeding to next step.

# 7. Create Solution
Once your user-item interaction and Item data have finished creating
(importing), It's time to setup our first solution. From your dashboard
select create solution. Please note that your dataset imports must have
finished before this step.

Use **personalize-workshop-solution** as the solution name.

Select **Automatic (AutoML)** from the recipe selection options.

Please note this step can take 30 to 45 minutes to complete. Proceed to next step whilst this step is processing in the background.

# 8 Test our campaign using the single page demo app 

## 8.1 Configure amplify project

Go to the root of your working directory (something like
~/environment/personalize-workshop) and execute

```sh
amplify init
```

Please make sure you deploy in the same region as per personalize
solution.

Amplify CLI will ask a few questions to initialize the project. Please
use following answers

Do you want to use an existing environment? (Y/n): No

Enter a name for the environment workshop: pworkshop

Do you want to use an AWS profile? (Y/n): Yes (then select default)

Now install required node modules by running

```sh
npm install --save
```

## 8.2 Run the app in preview
Using the terminal execute

```sh
npm start
```

Once the build has completed, select Preview-\>Preview Running
Application from the cloud9 top menu.

![alt text](workshop-images/8a.png)

You should now see a preview window with your app

![alt text](workshop-images/8b.png)

At the top right of your preview click the icon ![alt text](workshop-images/8dd.png) to preview the app in a separate browser tab.

![alt text](workshop-images/8d.png)

Once your new preview tab is open you can close the preview tab inside
the cloud9 to have more space for your IDE.

## 8.3 Test using the pre-deployed personalize campaign
Whilst we wait for the training to complete we will test first using a
campaign we deployed earlier using the same dataset.

Press the Fetch pretrained button on the left. Feel free to change the
user id to see different recommendations.

![alt text](workshop-images/8ee.png)

Our single page application is calling a public rest endpoint from a
previously deployed version of the workshop which was also trained with
the same dataset. You should see recommendations listed every time you
press the fetch pretrained.

![alt text](workshop-images/8e.png)

# 9. Create Campaign

Once your solution creation is active you are ready to create a campaign so that your application can get recommendations.

In the personalize dashboard click start next to campaign creation. 

![alt text](workshop-images/9a.png)


In the create new campaign screen use **personalize-workshop-campaign**
as the campaign name.

Select the solution name you created in the earlier part of this
workshop

Leave the minimum provisioned transactions per second to 1.

Click **create campaign**

![alt text](workshop-images/9b.png)

You should now see your new campaign.

![alt text](workshop-images/9c.png)

You can check the campaign status by selecting the details tab.

![alt text](workshop-images/9d.png)

You can start using it once the status shows as active. This step can
take five to ten minutes.

Once the campaign shows as active, go back to the campaign homepage to
test it.

![alt text](workshop-images/9e.png)

Input a user id (example 5) and click the Get Recommendations button.

You should see a list of recommended movie IDs

![alt text](workshop-images/9f.png)

## 9.1 Configure your campaign details in your single page application
Once your campaign is active, go back to your Cloud9 IDE and to edit
file

**/amplify/backend/function/personalizeworskhopeaea06ed/src/app.js**

![alt text](workshop-images/9h.png)

Change the value of campaignArn to the arn of your campaign in
personalize.

![alt text](workshop-images/9i.png)

We now need to deploy our amplify backend. In the Cloud9 terminal
execute

```sh
  amplify push
```

and answer yes when asked if you are sure if you want to continue. This
will deploy an API gateway endpoint and the lambda function you edited.
Your lambda function will be connecting to the Personalize campaign.

## 9.2 Get recommendations


Once your Amplify backend has been deployed, you can get recommendations
from your own campaign by entering a user ID and pressing the FETCH
button. Results will appear on the right.

![alt text](workshop-images/9j.png)

# 10. Clean-up
Time to clean up by removing the resources of our workshop.

In your cloud9 environment using the terminal run **amplify env remove
workshop** to delete your provisioned cloud environment resources.

In the Personalize console delete your campaign; once complete delete
your solution and then the datasets.

Delete your S3 bucket.

Stop and delete your cloud9 environment

# Appendix 1
Create a new policy with the statement below and attach to your role.

This step is **only required** if you encounter a problem creating a new
role in the personalize console.
